# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repository serves as a companion guide for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) offered by DataTalksClub, a free online course delving into the practical applications of Data Engineering. Here, you'll find comprehensive materials and exercises to follow along with the course and gain hands-on experience.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should feel comfortable with coding and command line and know the basics of SQL. Prior experience with Python will be helpful, but you can pick up Python relatively fast if you have experience with other programming languages.
